There are classic diffing algorithms with O(n³) time complexity, which might be used for creating a tree of React elements. But it means for displaying 1000 elements would require one billion comparisons.
Instead, React implements a heuristic O(n) algorithm with an assumption that the developer can hint at which child elements may be stable across different renders with a keyprop.
